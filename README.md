# magento-2-open-graph-tags
Magento 2's Open Graph Tags module allows you to manage titles, descriptions, and photos when someone shares a product, category, or CMS page on social media channels. Manage Open Graph data (such as OG tags, social media tags, Twitter cards, and so on) to set your postings apart from others on social media.
